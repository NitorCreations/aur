This version implements the same thing without awe.js, only using [jsartoolkit5](https://github.com/artoolkit/jsartoolkit5) for tracking and three.js for rendering the scene. As a bonus, it'll use back camera when there's one available (e.g. on a phone).

This is more of a PoC, using only one static model (Pasi's) without the "catch'em all" minigame or any extras like links to SoMe and such.

Also, currently this uses a static 3x3 matrix marker (QR tracking needs investigation still)
